Machine Learning models using R Programming - Cardiotocography Analysis

Cardiotocograms are widely used for assessment of fetal wellbeing and has been the mainstay of fetal monitoring for over 50 years. The fetal heart rate fluctuations and their temporal correlation with uterine contractions are captured by cardiotocography (CTG). The goal of obtaining a cardiotocography analysis is to identify infants who may be anemic (hypoxic) in order to direct further evaluations of fetal welfare or decide whether the baby has to be delivered through caesarean section or assisted vaginal birth. The diagnostic features were measured and automatically processed from 2126 Fetal Cardiotocograms (CTGs). Classification and Clustering methods were used to classify the samples into (Normal-1, Suspect-2, Pathologic-3) to provide adequate and appropriate healthcare. 

The classification code for k-nearest neighbor, naive bayes classifier, random forest model, and desicion tree classifier is found in the SDM2Script.Rmd file and the clustering and principal component analysis is found in the knn(2).rmd file.
